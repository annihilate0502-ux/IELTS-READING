        label: "A",
        text: "The internet, as we know it today, is the result of decades of research, development, and collaboration across numerous scientific and governmental organisations. Its origins can be traced back to the late 1960s, when the United States Department of Defense funded a project known as ARPANET — the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. This early network was designed not as a tool for public communication, but as a means of ensuring that military and research communications could survive a nuclear attack by rerouting signals if part of the network were destroyed."
      },
      {
        label: "B",
        text: "The concept of packet switching, a method of breaking data into small chunks that are transmitted independently and reassembled at the destination, was central to ARPANET's design. This contrasted sharply with the circuit-switched telephone networks of the time, which required a dedicated connection between two parties for the duration of a call. Packet switching allowed multiple users to share the same network infrastructure, greatly improving efficiency and resilience."
      },
      {
        label: "C",
        text: "Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, ARPANET expanded beyond its original military purpose and began connecting universities and research institutions. A key development during this period was the creation of TCP/IP — the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol — in 1983. TCP/IP established a common language for computers on the network to communicate, and it remains the foundational protocol of the internet to this day. The shift to TCP/IP is often regarded as the birth of the modern internet."
      },
      {
        label: "D",
        text: "The transformation of the internet from a tool used exclusively by researchers and academics into a global public resource was largely driven by the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989 by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, who was working at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research. Berners-Lee's vision was to create a system in which documents stored on different computers could be linked together through hyperlinks, making information far easier to navigate and share."
      },
      {
        label: "E",
        text: "The release of Mosaic in 1993, the first widely used web browser with a graphical interface, made the World Wide Web accessible to non-technical users for the first time. This triggered an explosion in internet usage and gave rise to the 'dot-com' era of the 1990s, during which thousands of new companies rushed to establish an online presence. While many of these ventures failed spectacularly, the period laid the groundwork for the digital economy that dominates commerce today."

        text: "Today, the internet connects billions of people and devices across the globe and has fundamentally altered how societies operate. From communication and entertainment to healthcare, education, and governance, the internet's influence is pervasive and growing. Yet alongside its enormous benefits come significant challenges: cybersecurity threats, misinformation, digital inequality, and concerns over privacy and the concentration of power in the hands of a small number of large technology corporations. How societies choose to govern and regulate this technology will likely be one of the defining questions of the 21st century."

    source: "Adapted from academic sources",
    body: [
      {
        label: "A",
        text: "Urban farming — the practice of growing, processing, and distributing food within or around urban areas — is experiencing a global renaissance. From rooftop gardens in New York to vertical farms in Singapore, city dwellers are increasingly turning to agriculture as a way to supplement food supplies, reduce carbon footprints, and reconnect with the natural world. Proponents argue that urban farming has the potential to transform cities from purely consumptive environments into productive ecosystems."
      },
      {
        label: "B",
        text: "The history of urban agriculture stretches back centuries. During World War II, 'victory gardens' in the United States and United Kingdom produced a significant proportion of the vegetables consumed by civilian populations. In Cuba, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent loss of food imports, the government promoted urban agriculture so effectively that Havana now produces a substantial share of its own fresh produce. These historical examples demonstrate that urban farming flourishes most dramatically in times of crisis or necessity."
      },
      {
        label: "C",
        text: "Modern urban farming takes many forms. Community gardens provide shared green space where residents grow their own fruits and vegetables. Rooftop farming makes use of otherwise wasted space atop apartment buildings and offices. Vertical farming, perhaps the most technologically advanced approach, involves growing crops in stacked layers within indoor facilities, often using hydroponics — a system in which plants grow in nutrient-rich water rather than soil — and artificial LED lighting. Vertical farms can produce crops year-round, regardless of climate or season, and use significantly less water than traditional agriculture."
      },
      {
        label: "D",
        text: "Despite its promise, urban farming faces substantial challenges. Land in cities is extremely expensive and scarce, meaning that unless buildings are specifically designed to incorporate growing space, farming must compete with housing, offices, and other commercial uses. The energy demands of vertical farms in particular are considerable; while they save water, the electricity required to power artificial lighting and climate control systems can make them expensive and, depending on the energy source, potentially less environmentally friendly than conventional farming."
      },
      {
        label: "E",
        text: "There are also questions about the scale at which urban farming can realistically operate. Critics point out that even the most productive urban farms can supply only a small fraction of a city's food needs. A study conducted in the United Kingdom estimated that urban agriculture could realistically supply no more than 10% of London's vegetable consumption, even if every available space were used. For staple crops such as wheat, rice, and maize, which require vast areas of land, urban farming is simply not a viable alternative to rural agriculture."
      },
      {
        label: "F",
        text: "Nevertheless, advocates of urban farming emphasise its social and psychological benefits alongside its environmental credentials. Urban farms and community gardens have been shown to reduce stress, promote physical activity, and foster a sense of community among participants. In low-income neighbourhoods with limited access to fresh produce — areas sometimes described as 'food deserts' — community gardens can significantly improve residents' diets and overall health. For many urban farming enthusiasts, the goal is not to replace conventional agriculture, but to complement it and to reintroduce urban populations to the processes by which food is grown."

        text: "For much of the 20th century, economists operated under the assumption that human beings are fundamentally rational agents — individuals who gather available information, weigh up the costs and benefits of different courses of action, and make choices that maximise their own interests. This model, known as the Rational Actor Model, underpinned much of classical economics and public policy. However, from the 1970s onwards, research in cognitive psychology began to reveal that real human decision-making is far more complex, inconsistent, and predictably irrational than this model suggested."
      },
      {
        label: "B",
        text: "The pioneering work of Israeli-American psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky was instrumental in establishing the field now known as behavioural economics. Their research demonstrated that people rely heavily on mental shortcuts, or heuristics, when making decisions. While these shortcuts are often useful — allowing us to navigate a complex world without being paralysed by too much information — they can also lead to systematic errors in judgement, which Kahneman and Tversky termed 'cognitive biases'."
      },
      {
        label: "C",
        text: "One of the most well-documented cognitive biases is anchoring, the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making a decision. In one experiment, participants were asked to estimate the percentage of African countries in the United Nations. Before answering, they were shown a randomly generated number — either high or low — spun on a wheel. Remarkably, participants' estimates were significantly influenced by this irrelevant number: those who saw a high number gave higher estimates, and those who saw a low number gave lower ones."
      },
      {
        label: "D",
        text: "Another influential concept from Kahneman and Tversky's research is loss aversion — the idea that the pain of losing something is psychologically more powerful than the pleasure of gaining something of equivalent value. Studies suggest that losses feel roughly twice as significant as equivalent gains. This asymmetry has profound implications for economics and finance: it helps explain why investors hold onto losing stocks for too long, why people avoid fair gambles, and why insurance products are so attractive even when statistically poor value."

      {
        label: "E",
        text: "The concept of 'choice architecture' — the idea that the way options are presented can dramatically influence the choices people make — has found widespread application in public policy. Governments and organisations have used insights from behavioural economics to 'nudge' people towards better decisions. For example, making organ donation an opt-out rather than an opt-in system has dramatically increased donation rates in several countries. Similarly, enrolling employees in pension schemes by default, while allowing them to opt out, has significantly boosted retirement savings."

      {
        label: "F",
        text: "Critics of behavioural economics raise several concerns. Some argue that the findings, many of which are based on laboratory experiments, do not necessarily translate to real-world behaviour, where the stakes are higher and people have more time and motivation to think carefully. Others contend that nudge policies are paternalistic — that governments should not manipulate the decision-making environment but instead trust individuals to make their own choices. Despite these criticisms, behavioural economics has had a transformative impact on how we understand human behaviour and design systems intended to serve human needs."

        { label: "A", text: "On a summer evening, the centre of a large city can remain warmer than nearby countryside. Roads, roofs and walls absorb energy from sunlight during the day and release it slowly after sunset. This pattern, often called the urban heat-island effect, is made stronger by limited shade and by heat produced by vehicles and buildings. The difference is not identical in every city: weather, building design and local geography all influence it." },
        { label: "B", text: "Planting trees is a familiar response, but the benefits depend on where and how they are planted. A row of trees can shade a pavement and reduce the amount of sunlight reaching a building. Leaves also release water vapour, which can cool the surrounding air. Yet young trees provide little shade for several years, and poorly chosen species may struggle in dry streets. City planners therefore need to consider water supply, root space and the needs of local residents." },
        { label: "C", text: "Some councils have tested reflective roofs. These surfaces send more sunlight back into the atmosphere than dark materials do, so buildings may absorb less heat. A reflective roof can lower indoor temperatures, especially in buildings with little insulation. It does not, however, cool every street directly. Researchers also warn that results from one neighbourhood cannot automatically be applied to another, because street width, wind and building height affect air movement." },
        { label: "D", text: "No single measure solves urban heat. A city may combine tree cover, shaded bus stops, reflective materials and public cooling rooms during heatwaves. The most useful plans begin by mapping which streets and buildings become hottest and identifying who is most exposed. Older people, outdoor workers and households without reliable cooling may face greater risks. For this reason, some researchers argue that heat policy should be judged not only by average temperature changes but also by whether protection reaches the most vulnerable residents." }

        { label: "A", text: "Researchers often describe attention as if it were a limited resource that can be directed, divided or exhausted. This metaphor is useful, but it can also hide an important distinction: noticing a signal is not the same as understanding it. A person may detect a sound while concentrating on a task yet fail to identify its source. Experiments that measure only whether a signal was detected may therefore overestimate how much information entered conscious awareness." },
        { label: "B", text: "One method for studying attention asks participants to respond to a target that appears among other visual items. When the target is predictable, responses usually become faster. This improvement is sometimes interpreted as evidence that attention has become more efficient. However, participants may also have learned the rhythm of the task or adopted a strategy that prioritises speed over accuracy. To distinguish these explanations, researchers record both response time and errors, and vary the interval between trials." },
        { label: "C", text: "A second challenge is that laboratory tasks remove many distractions found in daily life. A quiet room makes it easier to control conditions, but it may also change the behaviour being studied. In a field study of commuters, for example, messages were noticed less consistently when people were navigating unfamiliar stations than when they were seated in a quiet room. The comparison does not prove that laboratory results are useless; instead, it suggests that findings should be tested under more than one set of conditions." },
        { label: "D", text: "Attention is also shaped by expectations. If people are told that a rare event may occur, they may monitor for it, but this does not guarantee that they will recognise it correctly. In one experiment, volunteers watching a moving display sometimes reported a meaningful pattern where none had been designed. The researchers argued that expectation can guide perception without determining it completely: prior knowledge influences what people look for, while the available evidence still places limits on what they can reasonably conclude." },
        { label: "E", text: "These findings have practical consequences for the design of alarms, dashboards and public information. Adding more alerts may seem helpful, yet frequent signals can encourage users to ignore them or respond automatically. Designers can reduce this risk by making signals distinct, testing them with representative users and checking whether people interpret them as intended. The central question is not simply whether a warning is visible, but whether it attracts attention at the right moment and supports an appropriate decision." }

        { label: "A", text: "Salt marshes form where sheltered coastlines are regularly covered by the tide. Their grasses slow moving water and trap fine sediment, gradually building low platforms that can reduce the force of waves. These wetlands also provide feeding and breeding areas for fish and birds. In recent decades, researchers have drawn attention to another function: marsh plants and soils store carbon that might otherwise return to the atmosphere." },
        { label: "B", text: "Many marshes were drained or separated from the sea by embankments to create farmland and protect buildings. Such barriers reduced flooding in some places, but they also interrupted the movement of water and sediment. Where a marsh could no longer grow upwards by accumulating material, the ground sometimes became lower relative to the tide. In other sites, roads and walls prevented the wetland from moving inland as sea levels rose." },
        { label: "C", text: "Restoration projects often begin by changing how water enters a site. Rather than removing every embankment at once, engineers may create a limited opening and monitor the results through several tidal cycles. This gradual method can reveal whether the soil drains adequately and whether salt-tolerant plants return. It also gives nearby residents time to report problems. The approach is slower than a single large intervention, but it reduces uncertainty about how water will move across the land." },

They also record whether neighbouring homes or paths experience unexpected flooding.

Long-term observation is therefore part of restoration, not an optional final step." }

        { label: "A", text: "A map is often treated as a neutral picture of a place, but every map selects what to show and what to leave out. A route-planning service, for instance, may rank journeys by estimated time while giving less weight to slope, noise or the quality of a pavement. The route it presents as best is therefore best according to a particular measure, not necessarily according to every traveller's priorities. Digital maps can make these choices difficult to notice because their recommendations appear immediate and precise." },
        { label: "B", text: "When many users follow the same recommendation, the map may begin to alter the place it describes. A quiet side street can become busy, while a nearby shop receives new customers from people using walking directions. These effects are uneven: some businesses benefit, whereas residents may experience extra traffic or noise. The service has not physically built a road, yet its repeated suggestions help distribute movement across the urban network." },
        { label: "C", text: "Designers face a problem when several goals conflict. A route that is quickest for a cyclist may be uncomfortable for a child, and a path that avoids traffic may cross a poorly lit area. Adding more settings can give users control, but too many choices may make a service harder to use. Some researchers propose that route systems should explain why a recommendation appears and allow users to express relevant preferences, rather than presenting one ranking as universally correct." },
        { label: "D", text: "Evaluating these systems requires more than checking whether a traveller reaches a destination. Researchers can compare predicted and actual journey times, but they should also ask who uses the routes and who bears the resulting costs. A recommendation that works well for occasional visitors may not suit people with mobility limitations or residents whose streets receive diverted traffic. Audits conducted before and after a system changes its ranking can help reveal these distributional effects, although they cannot remove every uncertainty about why users choose a route." }
